$text = "After several days of rain that nearly floods Derry, Maine, five-year-old Georgie
Denbrough goes outside to play. He brings with him a paper boat his older brother, Bill,
made for him while sick in bed. Georgie helps with the boat by retrieving a box of paraffin from the shelves by the cellar stairs, even though the power is out and Georgie
imagines a monster lives in the cellar. Bill melts the paraffin in a bowl, and the boys
laugh and joke together while they smear the paraffin over the folded newspaper boat to
waterproof it. Before Georgie goes out to play, he kisses Bill's cheek, and Bill tells
Georgie to be careful.
Even though the rains have slackened, the gutters run with water. In his yellow hat and
slicker, Georgie follows his boat as it sails along Witcham Street, wishing Bill could be
with him to see it go because Georgie is not as good as Bill at telling stories about what
he sees. A current takes the boat into a storm drain, and Georgie peeks inside to look
for it.
In the drain Georgie sees a pair of yellow eyes. Scared, he begins to back away, but a
voice speaks to him. Georgie looks back and sees a clown; the clown introduces himself
as \"Mr. Bob Gray, also known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown.\" Georgie at first
thought the drain smelled like his scary cellar at home, but now he can smell a carnival.
Pennywise has Georgie's boat in one hand and a balloon in the other; he offers Georgie
both. When Georgie reaches forward, Pennywise grabs Georgie's arm and rips it off.
Georgie dies immediately. Dave Gardner, arriving \"only 45 seconds after the first
scream,\" finds Georgie's body.
The sheriff tells reporters Georgie must have got his arm stuck in a fast current in the
storm drain. Mrs. Denbrough is sedated in the local emergency room; Bill remains sick
in bed, listening to his father weep in another room. The paper boat continues through
the sewers to the Penobscot River and out to sea as the rain clouds break overhead.";
